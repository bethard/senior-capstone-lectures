\item<1> Men prefer ``rapport talk'' while women prefer ``report talk'' % No; the opposite
\item<1> Women were said to ``dominate'' a forum at 50\% of contributions % No; 30%
\item<1-2> Computer labs should schedule a ``women-only'' time

\item<1-2> 98\% of the U.S. population has access to 3 Mbps downstream
%100 million people in the U.S. lived in areas where they had access to broadband, but did not subscribe

What is wrong with the following experiments?
\begin{itemize}
% students from each group not assigned different teaching styles
\item Survey students, asking what learning style they prefer.
\pause
% students not divided into groups by learning style
\item Randomly assign students to different teaching styles, measure test performance for each style.
\end{itemize}

Results of literature review:
\begin{itemize}
\item Different people prefer different styles
\item No evidence they learn better from that style
