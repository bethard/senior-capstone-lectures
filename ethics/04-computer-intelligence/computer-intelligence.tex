Bill Joy believes that\ldots \hfill (\emph{select zero or more})
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
\item<1> the biggest advances in information technology come from the work of computer scientists % No, physical scientists
\item<1> we should be able to meet or exceed the Moore's law rate of progress for another 100 years % No, 30 years
\item<1> downloading our intelligence may be the only way to preserve our humanity % No, we would lose our humanity
\item<1-2> by 2030, computers should be powerful enough to support an intelligent robot
\item<1> we should destroy existing nanotechnology since it could lead to uncontrolled replicators obliterating life % No, "ideas can't be put back in a box", we should regulate it and maybe prevent future research
\item<1-2> regulation of genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics is more difficult than regulation of nuclear weapons % yes, because of the vast commercial uses
\item<1> near immortality through robotics has some significant dangers, but is a vision worth pursuing
\end{enumerate}
