Eric Raymond advises that:
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
\item<1> Good programmers know what to rewrite and reuse. Great ones know how to write it themselves.
\item<1> Recruiting co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
\item<1-2> Given enough beta-testers and co-developers, any problem can be characterized quickly with the fix being obvious to someone.
\item<1>  Smart code and dumb data structures works better than the other way around.

\begin{frame}{Open Source Development Principles}
\begin{itemize}
\item Openness
\begin{itemize}
\item Anyone can see the source
\item Anyone can give feedback
\item Anyone can see feedback of others
\end{itemize}
\item Transparency
\begin{itemize}
\item Project design plans and schedules
\item Defect tracking system
\end{itemize}
\item Rapid prototyping
\begin{itemize}
\item Release early and often
\item Incorporate patches/feedback frequently
\end{itemize}
\item Community
\begin{itemize}
\item Work together for a common purpose
\item Everyone's contributions are equal
\item Best ideas (as judged by community) win
\end{itemize}
