<p><em>Description</em>: CS499 is a Capstone course comprising a series of lectures spanning the CIS curriculum by faculty and guests on key topics in computer science together with lectures and in-depth discussion on computer ethics: further lectures and material on scientific inquiry, quantitative literacy and problem solving, all as they relate to the computer science field. Students take the Major Field Test in Computer Science as a requirement for completing this course. Writing is a significant part of this course, including term papers, and other significant writing assignments.</p>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
<li>Undergraduate level CM 101 Minimum Grade of C</li>
<li>Undergraduate level PHL 115 Minimum Grade of C</li>
</ul>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>Review key concepts and current research trends in computer science via lectures from professors in Computer and Informaiton Sciences.</li>
<li>Analyze, write about, and present on issues of ethics in computer science, including ethical codes, privacy concerns, security and hacking, and intellectual property.</li>
<li>Take the Major Field Test for Computer Science.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Assignments and Grading</h4>
<p>Students will be graded on presentation summaries, two papers, a class presentation and class participation. There will be no exams that count toward the course grade, but all students are required to take the Major Field Test.</p>
<ol>
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em;"><em>Major Field Test</em>:<br />All students must take the <a href="http://www.ets.org/mft/about/content/computer_science">Major Field Test for Computer Science</a> on:
<blockquote>Friday, November 8, 2013<br />2:30 PM - 5:30 PM<br />Campbell Hall 145</blockquote>
Students do not have to get a specific grade on the test, but <strong>any student that does not take the test will fail CS 499</strong>. All students enrolled in CS 499 will be automatically registered to take the Major Field Test.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em;"><em>Presentation Summaries</em>: (10*20 = 200 points)<br />A one-page summary and discussion of each of the guest lectures. (Each of the CIS faculty typically give one guest lecture that describes their area of computer science research.) Grading will emphasize completeness of the summary and relevance of the discussion. A student's ten best summaries will be added together. Summaries will be due one week from the date of the lecture.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em;"><em>First Paper</em>: (200 points)<br />A five-page paper (1250-1500 words) on topics discussed in class, topics presented in the textbook, or related topics subject to instructor approval. Grading will emphasize clear argumentation, use of sources to support claims, and proper grammar and spelling. The title and abstract will be due one week before the full paper is due.<br />Alternatively, a student can choose to create a 15 minute video report (vodcast) on a chosen topic. Choosing this alternative is subject to approval by the instructor. If you choose to create a vodcast, the topic has to be different from the second paper and class presentation.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em;"><em>Second Paper</em>: (200 points total)<br />A five-to-seven page paper (approximately 1500-1800 word) on topics discussed in class, topics presented in the textbook, or related topics subject to instructor approval. The topic must be different from that of the first paper. Grading will again emphasize clear argumentation, use of sources to support claims, and proper grammar and spelling. The title and abstract will be due one week before the full paper is due.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em;"><em>Class Presentation</em>: (200 points)<br />A 15-minute presentation of either the first or the second paper. Slides of some sort (PowerPoint, LaTeX/Beamer, Prezi, etc.) are required. Tentatively, the presentations will take place the last week of class, and will be assigned on a first come, first served basis.<br />Alternatively, a group of 2 to 3 students can choose to present a topic together as a team presentation. For example, the presentation could be a role-play showing a case study followed by a discussion of the ethical issues. Every member of the group has to get about the same amount of talk time, and the overall presentation should last 15 minutes times the number of students in the team. Choosing this alternative is subject to approval by the instructor.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em;"><em>Class Participation</em>: (200 points)<br />Active participation in class exercises, discussions, and lectures. Attendance alone will not be sufficient to receive full credit.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em;"><em>Final grade</em>: (1000 points)<br />The final grade is the sum of the individual grades above:

<p><em>Turnitin Policy</em>: All papers and summaries will be submitted to Turnitin for comparison against the most comprehensive digital repository of potentially plagiarizable material. Your work may be stored in Turnitin's database and used as reference for future comparisons.</p>
<p><em>Late Submission</em>: All assignments are due as indicated on BBLearn. Any assignment turned in late will receive at most 70% of the points for that assignment. Assignments not turned in before the assignment is no longer available on BBLearn (typically one week after the due date) will receive 0 points.</p>
<h4>Course Communication</h4>
<p><em>BBLearn</em>: You must regularly log in to BBLearn. Assignments, due dates, and most other information will only appear on BBLearn. However, do not use the email feature available within Blackboard to contact the instructor, instead email the instructor directly.</p>
<p><em>Email</em>: Students must use their official email address &lt;blazerid&gt;@uab.edu. New students must login and configure their email addresses. For more details on obtaining a blazerid and configuring email please see: <a href="http://www.uab.edu/blazerid" title="http://www.uab.edu/blazerid">http://www.uab.edu/blazerid</a>. Key email communications will be made using this address.</p>
<h4>Academic Honesty</h4>
<p>Students who plagiarize all or part of the assignments will be reported for academic dishonesty. Anyone who is caught cheating will receive a 0 on a given assignment. If a second offense occurs, the student will receive an F in the class. This includes both the provider of the information as well as the receiver of the information. Any student who violates the university's academic honesty policy will be reported for academic discipline. All university and department policies related to students are included here by implication.

<h4>Disability Accommodations</h4>
<p>If you are registered with Disability Support Services, please make an appointment with me as soon as possible to discuss accommodations that may be necessary.  If you have a disability but have not contacted Disability Support Services, please call 205-934-4205 or visit DSS at 1701 9th Ave. South.</p>
