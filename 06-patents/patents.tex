Stallman believes the \textbf{best} argument against software patents is:
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
\item<1-2> Software is essentially math, and math is not patentable
\item<1> Patents obfuscate an idea through the use of legal language
\item<1> Unknowingly violating patents is easy as they are hard to search
\item<1> Overturning patents is prohibitively expensive for small inventors
\end{enumerate}

Quinn believes the \textbf{worst} argument against software patents is:
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]

\item<1> Patents prevent improvements on existing technology
\item<1> Patents hold up innovation and economic growth
\item<1> The patent system is only affordable for large corporations
\end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{U.S. Patent Act}
Eligibility:

\begin{itemize}

Result:
\begin{itemize}
\item Idea is your exclusive property for 20 years
\item Right to exclude others from making, using, selling, importing
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Arguments for software patents}
\begin{itemize}
\item Patents stimulate innovation by providing a financial motivation
\item Patents provide enough detail for inventions to be re-implemented
\item ``any thing under the sun that is made by man'' deserves patent protection (S. Rep. No. 1979, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 5 (1952))
\item Strong economies and having a patent system are correlated
\item ``patents shall be available for any inventions\ldots in all fields of technology'' (World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights)
\item Invalid or overly broad patent claims can be overturned in court
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Arguments against software patents}
\begin{itemize}
\item Patents hinder innovation, preventing building on good ideas
\item Programs = lambda calculus; math is not patentable
\begin{itemize}
\item But 1998 Federal Circuit ruling: mathematical formula in the form of a 
computer program is patentable if it is applied in a useful way
\end{itemize}
\item Programs are covered by copyright; patents are unnecessary
\item Cycle is too slow for software ($>$2 year review, 20 year exclusive)
\item Legal language makes it costly to find relevant patents
\item Litigation costs can be extremely high
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A generation of software patents (Bessen, 2011)}
Patents 1976 -- 2006
\begin{itemize}
\item Patents per year increasing
\item Software patents growing relative to others (up to 25\%)
\item $<$$\frac{1}{3}$ software patents held by software firms
\item Patents in software firms increasing, but mostly just top 10 firms
\item Probability of patent being in lawsuit tripled since 1984
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{U.S. Government Accountability Office (2013)}
``Assessing Factors That Affect Patent Infringement Litigation Could Help Improve Patent Quality''
\begin{itemize}
\item Filing to decision $\sim$18 months, filing to issue $\sim$30 months
\item More software patents now than all other patent types combined
\item 31\% increase in patent infringement lawsuits in 2010-2011
\item 129\% increase in number of defendants in 2007-2011
\item 89\% of increase in defendants due to software patent cases
\item Litigation costs: \$300,000 to \$5 million in 2011
\item Median damage awarded: $>$\$5 million
\item Patent trolls (``patent monetization entities'') filed $\frac{1}{5}$ of lawsuits, suing $\frac{1}{3}$ of defendants, tripling number of defendants in 2007-2011
\end{itemize}
